DATA STRUCTURE THROUGH C LANGUAGE

not a language
set of algorithms used to structure the information

could be implemented in any language
in C, C++ we have to write the code for them

in Java and .NET they are already implemented in "collective framework"

Data analysis & storing & processing
while storing the information what are the algorithms we should follow

"abstract data types"
set of rules

we will see them 1 by 1

Arrays
Stacks
Queue
Linked List
Trees
Graphs

Algorithms

-LINEAR data structure              => sequential from, one is connected to only one ( Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked lists)
- NON LINEAR data structure         => one element is connected to a number of elements (trees, graphs)

what do you need to know for implementing a data structure?

- functions
- arrays
- functions
- pointers
- d m a
